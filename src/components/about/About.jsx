            Hello! I'm Leandro a Programmer/Developer based in Lisbon, Portugal with a big passion for Gameplay Programming.
            I also have experience in other fields such as AI, AR, VR, and Front/Back-End Development!
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy creating things like video games and applications that allow me to think outside the box while using
            a wide variety of technologies. My goal is to learn as much as possible while providing incredible
            experiences and keeping the systems behind them as clean and performant as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a bachelor's degree in VideoGames from <a href="https://www.ulusofona.pt/" target="blank">Lus√≥fona University</a>,
            in which I developed several applications throughout the last 4 years, ranging from mobile apps, AR apps, VR
            games, Online Games, and even developing my own mini game engine for the Windows CMD. Having already
            previously obtained an EQF level 4 in Programming and Management of Computer Systems from
            <a href="https://ae-ginestalmachado.pt/">AEGM</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently in the process of finishing my Master's degree in Computer Engineering!
